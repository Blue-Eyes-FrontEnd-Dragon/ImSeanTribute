Simply install yarn on the local machine.

    Run: yarn install - installs dependencies from package.json

    Run: grunt watch - watch and compile css

    Additionally: yarn global add live-server or npm install live-server to allow live-reload


    live-reload usage:

        run "npm install -g live-server"

        run "live-server" in the project directory.


    Check Sass is running:

        Run: grunt watch

        Save the Scss file

        The background should turn purple
