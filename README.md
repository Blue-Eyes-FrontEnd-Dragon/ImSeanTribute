SÃ©an Hopkins Tribute

Practice project for further developing design skills.

Note: There are no media queries in this project, it will not display correctly on mobile
      the intention of this project is to improve my colour theory and typography knowledge, 
      along with the uniformity between elements of a page.

to run this project clone the git respository and install yarn.

    run: yarn install

    run: grunt watch (if you want to play with the scss)

To make a responsive site:
      Use css-grid and flexbox along with media-queries
